For this program you need to put the following files into the same folder:

Lab02.cpp
deSelsort.h
binSearch.h
makefile

When you have put all four files in the same location you should then 
type in the terminal "make".
This should compile Lab02.cpp, deSelsort.h, and binSearch.h together and produce an 
executable file called "prog".
To use "prog", the user should type "./prog" into the terminal, and the 
program should run.
