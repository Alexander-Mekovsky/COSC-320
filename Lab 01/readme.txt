For this program you need to put the following files into the same folder:
    
    main.cpp
    deSelsort.h
    makefile

When you have put all three files in the same location you should then type in the terminal "make".
This should compile main.cpp and deSelsort.h together and produce an executable file called "prog".
To use "prog", the user should type "./prog" into the terminal, and the program should run.
