There are two files to this lab: one cpp files and one dat file. The cpp file is called lab_09.cpp. This cpp file works directly with the dat file graphB.dat.
They are in the same folder, so no files have to be moved. In order to compile the lab, type the following into the terminal:

g++ lab_10.cpp

Upon doing this, you should get an "a.out" file which contains a compiled version of the cpp file. When you do, if you want to run the program, you should
type this in the terminal:

./a.out

When entered in the terminal, the program should run and you should get the results like the sample output.
