There are three files to this lab: two cpp files and one h file. The first cpp file is called lab06_set.cpp. This cpp file works directly with the
only h file, d_state.h, but they are in the same folder, so no files have to be moved. In order to compile the lab, type the following into the terminal:

g++ Lab06_set.cpp

Upon doing this, you should get an "a.out" file which contains a compiled version of the cpp file. When you do, if you want to run the program, you should
type this in the terminal:

./a.out

When entered in the terminal, the program should run and you should get the results like the sample output.



The next cpp file is lab06_map.cpp. Unlike the previous cpp file, there are no h files needed, so all you need to do is compile the lab. To do so: type this in the terminal:

g++ Lab06_set.cpp

Upon doing this, you should get an "a.out" file which contains a compiled version of the cpp file. When you do, if you want to run the program, you should
type this in the terminal:

./a.out

When entered in the terminal, the program should run and you should get the results like the sample output.
