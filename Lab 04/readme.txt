There are six files to this lab: one cpp files, and five h files. The cpp file is "Lab_04.cpp". The five .h files are as follows: "inf2ptsf.h", "d_tnodel.h", "d_tnode.h",
"d_expsym.h", and "d_except.h". These files are in the same folder, so you don't have to move any files. In order to compile the lab, type the following into the terminal:

g++ Lab_04.cpp

Upon doing this, you should get an "a.out" file which contains a compiled version of the cpp file. When you do, if you want to run the program, you should type this in the terminal:

./a.out

When entered in the terminal, the program should run and you should get the results like the sample output.
