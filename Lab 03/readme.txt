There are four files to this lab: two cpp files, and two h files. The first pair is "Lab03_01.cpp" and "countOneChild.h". These two go together to solve the first
part of the lab. To make them work you need to group them together in the same location. As you do, to compile the cpp file, you need to type in the terminal:

g++ Lab03_01.cpp

Upon doing this, you should get an "a.out" file within the location of the two files. When you do, if you want to run the program, you should type this in the terminal:

./a.out

When entered in the terminal, the program should run and you should get the answer to the first part of the lab. The second part of the lab follows the same format
as for the first part, but instead of using the above mentioned cpp and h file, you should instead use "Lab03_02.cpp" and "max.h". Once you put these two files in the
same location, to compile the program you should type this in the terminal:

g++ Lab03_02.cpp

Upon doing this, you should get an "a.out" file within the location of the two files. When you do, if you want to run the program, you should type this in the terminal:

./a.out

When entered in the terminal, the program should run and you should get the answer to the second part of the lab.
