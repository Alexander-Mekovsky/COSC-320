There are five files to this lab: one cpp files and four h file. The cpp file is called lab08.cpp. This cpp file works directly with the
four h files: d_except.h, d_heap.h, d_pqueue.h, and preqrec.h. They are in the same folder, so no files have to be moved. In order to compile 
the lab, type the following into the terminal:

g++ lab08.cpp

Upon doing this, you should get an "a.out" file which contains a compiled version of the cpp file. When you do, if you want to run the program, you should
type this in the terminal:

./a.out

When entered in the terminal, the program should run and you should get the results like the sample output.
